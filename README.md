This project is a Tic Tac Toe game inspired by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course** on Udemy. The course provided the foundation for the core UI and initial game logic, but I've significantly modified and enhanced various parts to add my own touch and functionality.

## Key Modifications & Improvements

- **Winning Logic Enhancement**: Reworked the winning logic to make it more efficient and adaptable.
- **Additional Game Features**: Added features (you can specify what you added here, like a reset button, custom player markers, etc.) to make the game more interactive and engaging.
- **UI Adjustments**: Modified UI elements such as colors, layout, and buttons for a cleaner and more appealing look.
- **Code Optimization**: Improved the structure and readability of the code, making it more efficient and easier to maintain.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   git clone <your-repo-link>
   
   Navigate to the project folder:
   cd <project-folder>
   
   Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
   Start the application:
   npm run dev


## Features
Responsive design for various screen sizes.
Real-time feedback on player moves and game status.
Customizable settings (if you added any, like game modes or themes).

## How to Play
Player X and Player O take turns marking a square on the 3x3 grid.
The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If all squares are filled without a winning line, the game ends in a draw.
